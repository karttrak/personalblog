    <h1>Tools I use</h1>

    <p>
      Here are the tools I use to develop this site.
    </p>

    <h2>Hosting</h2>

    <p class="bold">
      <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Pages</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a free feature that GitHub offers. I went with this option because, well, it's free. It also allows me to update my site with my own code, which I did not have the freedom to do when using the free tier of Wordpress. If you are not a developer, there are simple themes you can use to get started. You also don't need to know how to code to add posts. As long as you can learn Markdown, which is a simplified formatting language that allows you to add headings, links, images, and style your text a little bit (among other things). This is enough to get you started. Anything more and you will probably want to pay for a more robust service that allows for more customizations without having to write code.
    </p>

    <h2>Domain name system (DNS)</h2>

    <p class="bold">
      <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Namecheap</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      I like it. There's not much going on for me here since I only use it for purchasing and configuring domains at the moment. They have more features available that I never touch, like website building/hosting and custom email hosting. I just like the UI better than GoDaddy, which was the only other DNS provider I had ever used before Namecheap.
    </p>

    <h2>Grammar/spell check</h2>

    <p class="bold">
      <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grammarly</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      I don't like to spend a lot of time proof-reading, so I usually just open up the Grammarly app, copy/paste the whole blog post into the app, and make the suggested fixes &mdash; or ignore them if I feel like what I wrote is truer to my <i>voice</i>. I just stick with the free version here. Sometimes I am curious to see what their <i>Pro</i> suggestions are, but then I remind myself that it isn't that important. Since I am writing in a casual environment, I don't mind if I have a few of the more complex grammar errors here and there. I try to write how I talk. This tool is mostly to catch spelling mistakes.
    </p>

    <h2>Everything else</h2>

    <p>
      Nothing yet. But I plan to add a whole lot more to this site, including development tools like a CSS preprocessor or a templating system to make my life easier. Check out the <a href="goals.html">Goals</a> page to see what I have on my to-do list.
