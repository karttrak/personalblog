        I like to come up with interesting solutions to problems that have already been solved.

        This blog is partly a playground where I can freshen up my development skills and learn new things about managing a website. It's also a great way for me to get my thoughts out and feel like I am helping someone, although it's probably only Don reading this when I send him a link every other day to read my new post.

        However, this website is also meant to prove that you don't need a fancy website as a pre-requisite to start a blog, or any other personal web project. That's why I structured this blog the way I did. I keep every post styled in its original form, looking exactly the same as the day it was posted. I will continually work on improving and redesigning the website as a whole (as free time and motivation permit), but each individual post remains a snapshot in history. And, since it would be a pain to check out every single post to see development, I also take a screenshot of the homepage every month so you can see a quick overview of how this website has changed over time.

        Why does this quote apply here? You have to shift the time scale down a bit, but if you are building your own website, you won't be able to develop a fully fleshed out, feature-complete website all by yourself in a week. You can, however, slowly progress toward your goals over the course of a couple of months or more. Now, if you are trying to build a professional website, then you definitely shouldn't be waiting two months before you decide on a design for your header. In that case, you at least want a minimum viable product before you make your website public. But for those wanting to start a little personal project and get a feel for web development, or for those who want to host a simple website for free, then I am hoping you will be able to find some inspiration here.
