        <h1>Final day "live tweet"</h1>

        <p>
          Today is my last day working at my current job. I want to make sure I don't forget anything, so I'm going to transcribe some of the day's events as they happen.
        </p>

        <p class="tweet-grid">
          <time>12:15 AM:</time> <span>Starting this post.</span>
          <time>12:37 AM:</time> <span>Just finished styling the layout using dummy data. I finally got to use CSS Grid for something useful. It was fun playing around with it to learn how it works.</span>
          <time>12:40 AM:</time> <span>Going to bed.</span>
          <time>6:55 AM:</time> <span>Getting out of bed.</span>
          <time>7:30 AM:</time> <span>Track workout!</span>
          <time>8:15 AM:</time> <span>Just made it home. I wanted to do a mile time trial since I was short on time, but the high school cross country team was on the track. I did three 800m repeats at mile pace instead.</span>
          <time>8:40 AM:</time> <span>I just found out my freshly-washed shorts that I wanted to wear today have a stain. Dang.</span>
          <time>8:45 AM:</time> <span>Heading out for my last commute into DC. I'm actually going to miss the metro and reading on the way into work.</span>
          <time>9:52 AM:</time> <span>Just finished standup. Now to head out to a chocolate store to pick up some assorted chocolates for the office and the security guards.</span>
          <time>12:07 PM:</time> <span>Dylan just got back with Stachowski's. That was super quick! He could work for Jimmy John's.</span>
          <time>2:50 PM:</time> <span>I just had a meeting with my boss. I wanted to tell him how much I appreciated working with him. It was <i>very</i> hard for me to say what I wanted to say without making it sound like I was hitting on him. He took it well though. He's a good guy.</span>
          <time>3:19 PM:</time> <span>Aww, Dylan just swung by with some beers for me! What a pal.</span>
          <time>4:09 PM:</time> <span>I just pushed my last bit of code! I really hope it works.</span>
          <time>4:29 PM:</time> <span>Now I'm chatting with a group of coworkers while drinking the aforementioned beers.</span>
          <time>4:51 PM:</time> <span>A friend made some pi&ntilde;a coladas for me! And dang, they look <i>fancy</i>!<br><img src="media/final-day-coladas.jpg" alt="Five pina coladas surrounding the top of a pineapple."></span>
          <time>5:27 PM:</time> <span>11 of us are heading out for happy hour.</span>
          <time>7:56 PM:</time> <span>Everyone has shuffled out. Time for me to head home.</span>
          <time>8:07 PM:</time> <span>The moon looks so bright today. I was able to get a decent photo on my phone! I've never been able to do that before. It looks dark because I had to turn the brightness all the way down, but it was still pretty bright out.<br><img src="media/final-day-moon.jpg" alt="The moon in its waxing gibbous phase."></span>
          <time>8:50 PM:</time> <span>Just made it home. That was it. My career as a software engineer is over.</span>
          <time>9:16 PM:</time> <span>I'm exhausted.</span>
          <time>9:24 PM:</time> <span>In bed. Feeling like an old fart.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>P.S.</b> I appreciate all the people who said they enjoyed working with me. So many people had an impact on me over the years. I'm glad I could make an impact on others as well.
