        <h1>I did a gymnastic</h1>

        <p>
          We got a new engineer in the office. We started talking and she mentioned she does gymnastics at a gym not too far from me. I told her I used to do gymnastics in college and I wouldn't mind trying it out again. That was three months ago.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yesterday, I finally decided to give it a shot. I talked to her about it again and asked if it was beginner-friendly, as I haven't practiced gymnastics in around five years. She encouraged me to check it out, saying they are very welcoming and that she has even brought a friend with zero gymnastics experience there and they had a good time.
        </p>

        <p>
          It started off even better than I thought. I expected to be kind of wandering around by myself, struggling to work in with these experienced tumblers and get some floor time. However, everyone was immediately friendly. They saw that I was new, introduced themselves, and invited me into their conversation. We all stretched and warmed up together. I bonded with a guy who was practicing moves that I have had an interest in learning in the past &mdash; b-twist and aerial. He gave me some pointers so I could get started learning them again.
        </p>

        <p>
          I spent most of my time there testing myself and seeing if I could still throw the moves I learned back in college. Surprisingly, I picked it back up pretty quickly. Muscle memory is an amazing thing. My form was pretty sloppy, but at least I'm not starting back at ground zero. I was even able to do a front full on the tumble track &mdash; I wasn't ready to try it on the floor on day 1. That was basically the only move I practiced in college, so I am happy it stuck with me. Unfortunately, I don't have any pictures or videos from the night. Maybe I'll record something in a future session so I can show off to y'all a bit. ;)
        </p>

          I have always been too scared to do much back tumbling. I learned back handspring and back tuck a couple times, but they never lasted more than two days before I got in my own head and lost the courage to keep throwing them. That's my goal now, to re-learn back tuck and keep doing it consistently. Once I have that, I'd love to be able to string together a couple moves so I could have an actual tumbling pass. I'm thinking front tuck to roundoff to back handspring to back tuck. That has always been my dream ever since I started learning gymnastics.
