        <h1>Finished training. Am driver.</h1>

        <p>
          Class wrapped up early today. I got out at 3 PM, so I called my parents to let them know I'm done. My dad immediately told me Amazon had a small route that they needed picked up today. One of our rockstar drivers was almost done with his route already. I got sent out on a goose chase to find this guy I don't know.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wandered around looking for "Matt. He's wearing a red Bulls shirt." That's all I had as far as personally identifying information. I asked around until I saw a guy in a red shirt who, luckily, turned out to be Matt. I told him we could pick up the route. He literally jumped for joy and pointed me to the packages that needed to go out for delivery.
        </p>

        <p>
          My plan was to sit around for half an hour and wait for our driver to come back to the warehouse so I could help him load up and send him back out on the road. But then a major storm swept through the area. All of our drivers had to wait out the storm for the hour. Our driver finally made it back at 5 PM &mdash; a little late to pick up another route, but we already agreed to take it. I went with him to help speed things up.
        </p>

        <p>
          We hit rush hour traffic on our way out, which chomped another 30 minutes out of our day. We then found out that if we bring any packages back, it counts against us. Here we are trying to do a favor for someone only to find out that we may actually take a big financial hit by losing our bonus if we can't do this favor fast enough. The drop deadline to deliver packages is 9 PM. It was 6 PM by the time we got to the first stop, giving us only 3 hours to complete a 4-hour route.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had no idea how to deliver packages the "right" way, so my main goal was simply not to slow our guy down. I figured the best thing I could do was sort packages while he drove and delivered. So that's what I did. We were making good time. But then the sun set and the houses got further and further apart. We also had to navigate long, winding driveways. I had to spot our driver a few times while he backed out of some driveways that didn't have a place to turn around. However, we ended up finishing the route in time, but just barely. It was 8:45 PM when we dropped off the last package and started heading back to the warehouse. I decided to spend the night at my parents' house to make my next morning a little easier. Our driver did not have that luxury. He had to make the 40-minute commute back home, just to come back again bright and early tomorrow morning.
