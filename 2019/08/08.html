        <h1>Systems vs. goals</h1>

        <p>
          I started reading <i>How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big</i> by Scott Adams. He is the author of Dilbert, so his writing style is pretty entertaining to read. I'm also enjoying hearing his view on how to become successful. He's very open about all his failures because he knows failure is common on the path to success.
        </p>

        <p>
          The last chapter I read is about focusing on the systems you implement rather than goals you set when you want to progress yourself or your business. He's got a pretty bleak view of goals.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            To put it bluntly, goals are for losers. That’s literally true most of the time. For example, if your goal is to lose ten pounds, you will spend every moment until you reach the goal—if you reach it at all—feeling as if you were short of your goal. In other words, goal-oriented people exist in a state of nearly continuous failure that they hope will be temporary. That feeling wears on you. In time, it becomes heavy and uncomfortable. It might even drive you out of the game.
          </p>

          However, this directly conflicts with all the advice I've been hearing from very successful people over the past few years. Plenty of people will tell you, "Set goals! And write them down!" Warren Buffet even has his famous 5/25 rule of goal prioritization. The Sparknotes version of it is to write down your top 25 goals. Circle the top 5 and focus solely on those. The remaining 20 are distractions and must be avoided at all costs. With that in mind, I figured spending time with family and friends must be a goal. Right? I don't want to avoid the people in my life I care most about. And work must be a goal too. That's where I spend most of my waking hours. But I don't really <i>want</i> to work. I want to retire. So why is work in my list of top priorities? It starts to get a little confusing as to what a goal even <i>is</i>. Maybe I'm thinking too long-term in my goals to apply Buffett's strategy.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is where Mr. Dilbert's advice comes in.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Goal-oriented people exist in a state of continuous presuccess failure at best, and permanent failure at worst if things never work out. Systems people succeed every time they apply their systems, in the sense that they did what they intended to do. The goals people are fighting the feeling of discouragement at each turn. The systems people are feeling good every time they apply their system. That’s a big difference in terms of maintaining your personal energy in the right direction.

          My system when it comes to this blog is to go to bed early so I can wake up early and write before heading into work. I have no goal for a set amount to write. But I write. I feel good about it, no matter how much or how little I get done.
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't get me wrong, goals are great. I'm not going to stop making goals just because I read some author's advice on what works for him. And really, what is a system if not just a series of micro-goals? But I enjoyed this chapter because it helped me to clarify some of my goals that were more difficult to define. For example, now I can turn my goal of <b>maintain healthy relationships with family and friends</b> into two systems:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Spend time in-person with a friend or family member at least once per week</li>
          <li>Call a distant (in miles) relative every two weeks</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Both of those are easy to plan out and simple to follow. And a <i>lot</i> clearer than "maintain healthy relationships."
        </p>

        <p>
          I'll leave you with a little food for thought from Adams:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            My proposition is that if you study people who succeed, you will see that most of them follow systems, not goals. When goal-oriented people succeed in big ways, it makes news, and it makes an interesting story. That gives you a distorted view of how often goal-driven people succeed. When you apply your own truth filter to the idea that systems are better than goals, consider only the people you know personally. If you know some extra successful people, ask some probing questions about how they got where they did. I think you’ll find a system at the bottom of it all, and usually some extraordinary luck.
