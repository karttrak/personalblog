        <h1>Behind the site name</h1>

        <p>
          Last month brought a lot of name changes for this blog. We started on day 1 as <i>Kyle of Write</i>. However, that was just a bad pun, and I don't really want my own name to be contained in the blog name. It also didn't really have much to do with my intention for the blog, other than trying to write every day. After a stint of infrequent posts, I sat down and thought about why I wanted to create this blog. I want to work on my skills as a web developer. I also want to get over needing everything to be perfect all the time. Lastly, I want to show that you don't need everything figured out before starting a project. Just start, and you will get better from there. As a result, <i>Incremental Improvements</i> was born.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like the name, <i>Incremental Improvements</i>. It describes the intention of the blog. It's alliterative &mdash; and I <i>love</i> alliteration. However, it's a long name. Having a long name isn't the worst thing in the world (wide web). But it's a lot of typing, which increases the odds of someone &mdash; including myself &mdash; misspelling the name. It's also more difficult to create a logo that includes a long name. For the time being, I settled on <i>Small Improvements</i> as a temporary solution to save on a few characters.
        </p>

        <p>
          As you can imagine, I didn't care much for the name <i>Small Improvements</i> either. I thought of abbreviating the name somehow, which led me to <i>Smimps</i>. The name is much shorter and sounds interesting. However, it might be a little <i>too</i> interesting. I thought of what it'd be like to tell someone my blog name. I'd probably have to spell it for them so they could find it. Plus, it's not readily transparent what it means. Though the most important thing was that the domain name was available, which was not true for incrementalimprovements.com nor smallimprovements.com. I immediately bought smimps.com and switched the site over from kylethornburgh.com. My name was finally removed from the "branding."
        </p>

        <p>
          The site existed in this weird state for a few days of using smimps as the domain name but <i>Small Improvements</i> as the site name. That was fine, I guess. The domain doesn't <i>need</i> to match your brand name. But I didn't like it. I let it sit while I pondered the next iteration of name changes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, <i>Ink Imps</i> came to mind. I thought of <i>Inc Imps</i> before as a shortened version of <i>Incremental Improvements</i>, but that domain was taken. However, inkimps.com was available. It's basically the name idea as smimps, but it's a little easier to understand. I decided to make the switch. Now the domain name matches the site name for the first time since the blog's inception. I also like that "ink" fits with the theme of trying to write every day. Plus I can make the logo a cute little imp holding a quill.
