        <h1>Full-time delivery man</h1>

        <p>
          Today was my first full day of working a delivery company. I went over to my parents' house and we tried to check off as many things from our launch checklist as possible. We still have a lot to do tomorrow, but we also made pretty good progress today. We have our drivers scheduled. All our phones are set up, labeled, and ready for drivers to use during delivery. All the fuel cards are good to go. We laminated important info to hang in the vans tomorrow. And we went over the daily checklist we will have to go through before and after every delivery.
