      <h1>July lookback</h1>

      <p>
        July didn't bring very many visual changes, but the few changes I made were important. I finally came up with a real name for the blog and switched over to a new domain. HTTPS ended up working easily this time around thanks to a new configuration in my GitHub Pages settings. I added a simple header with one link in the navigation menu. I didn't post <i>every</i> day, but I'm happy with the amount of content pushed out. 17 posts in July brings me to 40 posts in total!
      </p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>

      <h3>Progress made</h3>

      <p>
        Let's take a look back at the goals I accomplished in July:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Add a header (July 12th)</li>
        <li>Add an About page (July 22nd)</li>
        <li>Add a Development Goals page (July 31st)</li>
        <li>Add Google Analytics tracking (July 31st)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        However, the success of the Google Analytics goal is still up in the air. I can see users (me) who are currently viewing the site, so I know <i>something</i> is working, but it doesn't show me a summary of data after the fact. I am not sure how Google Analytics differs from Google Tag Manager. I got a "site tag" from the setup instructions in the Analytics tab, but I had to create a new account to get Tag Manager set up, which gave me its own tag to add to the page with different instructions. So I will have to circle back on this task and make sure I get it done correctly before too long. I will just have to look up some video explanation &mdash; it's not intuitive to me just from browsing the Google Analytics site. And I hate Google's documentation pages. They never seem clear and straightforward to me for whatever reason. Things always seem to be misaligned from their documentation pages and what I actually see when I am trying to follow their instructions. Just throwing that out there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moving on!
      </p>

      <h3>Going forward</h3>

      <p>
        There are a few things I want to get done in August as well. These are the goals I have prioritized for one reason or another:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Add a Tools page (this is actually going out today)</li>
        <li>Add a navigation menu on mobile</li>
        <li>Look into using new fonts</li>
        <li>Learn how to set up a CSS preprocessor</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Let's go over these briefly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tools page &mdash; it's another thing to go in the header and I've basically completed it already (at least the first iteration of it), so that's an easy one to check off.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mobile navigation will be good to add because I am adding more to the desktop navigation, but I am just hiding them on mobile due to limited header real estate on small screens. I need to code up a solution for this because I don't want a reduced mobile experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for new fonts, I've already done some exploration on that front. I just want to look at something different. I am not the biggest fan of Roboto Slab for my headings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, a CSS preprocessor would really ease up my styling workflow. I am already used to using SCSS from a prior job, and there are so many times I want to use mixins or variables, but I don't have access to those yet. I need to get this done. Plus, it would be good to have one shared folder for all my styling and then just compile everything into a single CSS file that I import into my HTML page.
      </p>

      <h3>Being optimistic</h3>

      <p>
        Lastly, I have some stretch goals that I would <i>like</i> to complete, but won't be bummed out if I don't get around to these right now. They are mostly based on free time and creative motivation.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Create a logo</li>
        <li>Create a favicon</li>
        <li>Create a gallery component for posts with many images</li>
      </ul>
