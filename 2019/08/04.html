        <h1>Roomie birfday</h1>

        <p>
          Today is my roommate's birthday! Which you <i>might</i> have been able to deduce from the cryptic title of the post...
        </p>

        <p>
          The day has just started, so not too much has happened yet. I just want to get a head start on today's post.
        </p>

        <p>
          We started off the day with the yuppiest meal known to mankind: avocado toast. Our version features a bagel base with a fried egg, topped with thinly-sliced avocado, pink Himalayan sea salt, cracked <a href="https://youtu.be/yenZLqXAzng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pepper pepper pepper</a>, and finished off with a drizzling of Cholula hot sauce. Paired with a cup of cold brew coffee. Yerp. I'm a millennial. And I ain't even ashamed. It was delicious.

          Next on today's schedule is some ultimate frisbee in the park.

        <h2>DSP progress update</h2>

        <p>
          Last night, after getting home from Annapolis, I met up with my parents to get a tour of the warehouse to check out my new "office." I sat down with them and my dad showed me the hiring/onboarding process on his iPad. All the while a man was picking up business cards and sat around waiting for us to finish. My mom noticed him and called him over. We got talked about our business and offered him a job on the spot. He is currently driving for Amazon, but since they announced they are stopping their delivery service in favor of using DSPs, he needs to find a new job. He seems like he'd be a good fit for us.
        </p>

        <p>
          We went to my parents' house and they showed me all of the things we've gotten delivered recently. We are now in possession of a plethora of supplies, including, but not limited to, a box of uniforms and 24 phones to be used for delivery. I have to get all the devices set up for our drivers to use on day 1. Now I need to do some research for the best way to manage and sync up 20+ devices.
