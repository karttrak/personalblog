    Too much reading to do
  </h1>

  <p>
    I come across articles every single day at work that I want to read. Every time a topic that I want to learn more about pops into my head, I google it and open a handful of articles about it. Or a coworker will post some article in Slack that looks interesting. We even get a weekly email listing all the times my company has been mentioned online. Since we are a finance company, and I love reading about finance, this weekly email adds 10-15 articles to my reading list every week. I will open most of these articles up to check them out, but then I just want to read the whole thing. But then I see how long they are and how long it will take me to read all of them. I may read 1 or 2 of the shorter ones that I know I can skim through quickly, but I'll leave the longer ones for later. If I have too many tabs open, I'll save the articles somehow and close the tabs. However, I haven't found any way to save an article that I am willing to keep up with my reading list yet. I have tried emailing them to myself, bookmarking them, saving links in Google Keep, and saving them to Todoist or Notion. No matter what the method, I will just forget about them after a while and my reading list continues to grow. I am probably up to 100 articles by now (plus all the ones I haven't even sifted through from that weekly company email, which is another ~300-500).

    I have one more idea that may work. The only way I will keep an article in mind is if I keep a tab open as a constant reminder. I was playing around with Firefox yesterday (I usually use Chrome for my daily browsing) and noticed you can sync open tabs across devices. So I set up a Firefox account and started moving any open articles in Chrome over to Firefox (which I am also hoping will reduce CPU memory consumption since Chrome is so power hungry). If I always keep Firefox open at work and home, then this may be the constant reminder I need to start chipping away at my reading list. Or, most likely it will be another method that just piles up articles higher and higher...
