  <h1>
    Seattle friends
  </h1>

  <p>
    Two of my friends are visiting from Seattle right now. A bunch of my old college mates and I all met up with them at a restaurant called Open Road. I had an <i>amazing</i> burger. Anyway, these friends are one of the few married couples I hang out with, so it's fun to hear about the adult life and how they're livin' it. They recently bought a house and gave us a virtual tour on a phone. It looks nice! He said he's getting into doing yard work, and that makes him feel old. After dinner and drinks, we talked about heading to another restaurant/bar to continue the night. But then everyone was talking about how it was getting late and they were getting tired. It was 9:15! About half of us all agreed to meet up at someone's apartment to hang out a bit more, but even that didn't go beyond 10:30. God, we <i>are</i> getting old. You know it's bad when the <b>late crew</b> calls it a night before 11:00. But hey, it's a work night. Speaking of which, I need to get some sleep.
