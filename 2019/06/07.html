    Father's Day came early &ndash; Peloton and Indian dinner
  </h1>

  <p>
    I met up with my parents at the mall today. They wanted to check out the Peloton store and look at the bikes. They have been using the Peloton app for the last couple of years already, but they decided to go with cheaper indoor bikes. But then my dad saw a Peloton bike in person and heard all the great stories. Hook, line, and sinker. We went into the store and the saleswoman gave us a tour of the bike, let my parents try on some shoes and ride the bike a bit. They also had a father's day deal going on so my dad could walk out right away with a gift box after purchasing a bike. He said we'd "think it over" as we went to dinner. But you already knew he was all about it.

    We went to an Indian restaurant for dinner and ordered 3 dishes to share family-style: butter chicken, Shahi paneer, and raan of lamb, all deliciously prepared. My dad had to run back over to the Peloton store before it closed and buy a bike and shoes. I paid for the dinner to get some credit card points (still trying to reach that 3-month bonus). My mom said she'd pay me back, but I told her it'd be an early father's day treat.

    We met back up with my dad. A big smiled stretched across his face as he was carrying his Peloton gift box. Conveniently, we were standing right next to a Kung Fu Tea. I convinced my mom to try it, though my dad wanted to hold out for a Starbucks frap. All in all it was a good day.
