    Gettin' down 'n' dirty

  <p>
    I ran a Tough Mudder today! I did the half (5 miles) last year with some old coworker friends. We enjoyed it so much that the 3 of us decided to sign up for the full this year, and we just completed it. Last year the half took us about 2 hours to complete. I was wholly expecting it to take 4 hours this year, but we actually finished closer to the 3 hour mark. We definitely ran a lot more of it this year. It was super hot last year, and this year's course was under a lot of shade. I think that made a huge difference in our pace between obstacles. There were still pretty long lines at a few of the obstacles.

    There were a few interesting obstacles this year that I didn't get the chance to do last year. I think they save the more intense upper body obstacles for the full. There was one where you had to monkey bar over to a horizontal rotating wheel, spin around to reach another wheel oriented vertically, swing to another vertical wheel, and then swing to the platform. Then there was the Arctic Enema, which required you to fully submerge yourself in ice water. It was a shock to the system at first, but then it felt quite refreshing once you exited. A good way to cool off and wash off any mud that was caked on from previous obstacles. I still think my favorite was Everest (think Warped Wall from American Ninja Warrior). I love running, and climbing walls, so this combines both of my passions. Then you get to help others up, which can be even mroe difficult than getting yourself up in the first place. Everyone I've seen at Tough Mudders has been great about the teamwork aspect of the race, and people are always willing to stay back and help multiple people through before they move on. It's nice to see.

    Electroshock Therapy was my favorite obstacle from last year (that I had to sneak into, as it wasn't meant for participants in the half). It's basically strings hanging from scaffolding that you have to run through. Oh, and each string is electrified and has a chance of shocking you. This year, the shocks weren't quite as strong, which was disappointing. But there was one bonus for 2019 that was definitely lacking from 2018. Some adorable couple decided to get married at the Tough Mudder this year, and they chose this obstacle to snap a photo of them kissing. Right in the MIDDLE of the obstacle. At least, that was the plan. When they actually stopped to turn and kiss each other, they continued to get shocked. Their bodies convulsed with each wave of electricity that surged through them. They both collapsed to their knees, and then finally to the ground. Out of range of the wires, they could finally have their romantic, newlywed kiss while laying in a puddle of mud. However, they still had to make their way <i>out</i>. They tried getting up, which proved to be a challenge. Unable to get into full standing position, they squat-hobbled their way through the electrified forest and collapse over the mini hay barricade that marked the end of the obstacle. They were laughing the entire time.

    We finished the course with a 45-foot cargo net climb up and over the finish line, allowing us to see and congratulate all the other competitors running below. Once we crossed the finish ourselves, we were rewarded with a sweat band and t-shirt as proof of accomplishment. Not to mention all the free samples of power bars, protein shakes, and energy drinks that follow the traveling circus that is Tough Mudder. After we replenished, we snapped a few photos in front of the Tough Mudder sign. It's amazing how luxurious they can make hosing off outside and changing in a crowded tent full of random naked dudes, but man did I feel like a million bucks after that. It's all perspective, I guess.
