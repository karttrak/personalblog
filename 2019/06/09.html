  <h1>
    Moving and crabs
  </h1>

  <p>
    One of my friends recently bought a house. She asked me to help her move into her new home yesterday. I was only recruited for truck unload duty, so I lucked out. She had a whole truck for her own stuff, plus at least one roommate was moving in at the same time as well. I don't know what this woman needs 4 couches for. She also had us moving <i>dirt!</i> It was a little hectic with so many people there, but that also made it go by really quickly. We had the whole thing done in an hour, so really it wasn't bad at all. We had plenty of time to go home and shower before dinner.

    We went to a seafood restaurant, but really they are known for their blue shell crabs. I've had blue shell crab before, but I was really out of practice and it took me a while to finish my first crab &ndash; one of six. But halfway through I started to get the hang of it and I was sailing through, and getting large chunks out with each joint I pulled off. It was so good. You can't beat Old Bay. We also had four pitchers of Yuengling... between the four of us... But that was over the course of two hours of eating. So really we aren't <i>that</i> bad.

    We moved the party over to a friend's condo. He was talking about this sweet tea vodka that he used to have a lot right out of college and how it was so good and you couldn't even really tell you were drinking alcohol. Naturally, we had to drink it to close out the night. We popped into the liquor store that is conveniently located right beneath his building and he bought a bottle. After purchasing a few mixers to go along with it, we were ready to go.

    It was such a beautiful day outside, so we had to sit out by the pool and enjoy. He was right. It tasted just like regular sweet tea, basically. Our mixer variety went along well with it too. Then before we knew it, we polished off the entire bottle. We originally considered getting a whole handle of it. Though really, the fifth was probably still a good call even though it wasn't "enough." Otherwise we all might have been passed out pool-side until the morning.
