    Flying out to Colorado
  </h1>

  <p>
    We fly out to Colorado today! "We" being my family and me. I'm excited for this because I haven't been out to see the western side of the country very much in the last 20 years (other than Utah last month, which was <i>gorgeous</i>). And we usually do beach vacations during summers, so family vacations have a history of being very hot. That's not the case this time. Temperatures are expected to be around 40-60 degrees the whole week.
