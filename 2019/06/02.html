  <h1>
    Family night out
  </h1>

  <p>
    Not with my family, but someone else's. Though I did get to share lunch and dinner with my parents, which is always enjoyable. But I went out with my friends to get pedicures. One of my friends was babysitting for one of his friends. They are some pretty cool kids, so it was a fun day. I got the pedicure with the same guys I hiked the 100k and went camping in Utah with. The pedicure was meant to be a relaxing reward for us after so much hiking, though we may have waited a little too long to be able to use that excuse. After the pedis, we all went out for some rolled ice cream. Then after <i>that</i>, we made our way to an indoor putt putt place, though we stuck to the arcade games and lazer mazes the whole time. It was fun being back in an arcade. I don't think I'd get too much out of playing those games myself anymore, but it's pretty cool to see how much fun the kids have there. Someone definitely thought my friend and I were a gay couple taking our kids for a family night out.

      They had a spiffy mural at the ice cream store. I decided to take a photo for the 'gram I don't have.
