  <h1>
    Google is trying to steal my iPhone
  </h1>

  <p>
    I recently bought a Google Pixel 3a. Google was running a good iPhone trade-in deal ($244 for my old 6s Plus!) so I went with that as well. I sent the trade-in box last week and finally heard back from Google. This is the email they sent me:
  </p>

  <div class="img-wrapper">

      <img class="center" src="images/google-trade-in.png" alt="An email response from Google saying I sent an empty box as my trade-in">
    </a>
  </div>

  <p>
    I contacted Google customer support via chat &ndash; they verified who I was and put me on hold a few times, then the guy escalated the case and said I'd hear back within 24 to 48 hours by some specialist team. It is now two days later and I've heard nothing. I called support, got transferred to the trade-in department, got put on hold a few more times, and told the trade-in was under investigation. I was then told I need the serial number and IMEI number of my old iPhone, the one I don't have anymore. I never wrote those numbers down because I didn't know they'd be needed for anything. I also recycled the iPhone box last week because I thought, "Well, there is no reason I'd never need <i>this</i> anymore!" But apparently the box might have had these numbers in there... Google support told me to call T-Mobile to get the serial and IMEI numbers. I asked him if they even received a phone at all. He asked me to describe the trade-in box I sent to them because it didn't match what they usually send. I described what I remembered and said there were instructions from Google in it. There were also 2 boxes I received because I accidentally requested 2 trade-ins, so I'm pretty sure it was actually Google and not some scam box. Oh, and they both had the correct trade-in IDs that were listed in my order history, so that adds a little bit of confidence. I asked again what they got in the package. he said it was "most likely empty." I wish they'd have taken a picture or something, or <i>at least</i> wrote down what they actually got, and didn't just pick from an ambiguous dropdown option.

    I then called T-Mobile (much friendlier customer support) and found out we didn't buy the phone through them &ndash; it was purchased through Apple. She transferred me to Apple (who let me choose my hold music, which is cool). Apple support asked for the IMEI number to look up the phone I was having an issue with. I told her I don't have that information and described the situation. She said she could not give me the IMEI number for security reasons. I emailed the Google customer support rep I talked with and told him the situation. I also included a question as to why they can't find my phone, and what condition the trade-in box was in when they received the package. I want to find out <i>why</i> exactly I am getting screwed out of $244. He later responded saying they received the box in "pristine condition" and it was empty when they opened it.

    I did some googling around to see if there are other ways of finding an IMEI number without a phone in hand. I learned that you can log in to iTunes and see any device associated with your account. Download iTunes. Log in. Can't log in. My password doesn't work anymore, even though I have it saved in LastPass. Not sure what happened here. The password looks like the one I've been using for the past couple years and I don't remember changing it. I go through the instructions to reset my password, but of course I need an Apple device to authenticate. I pulled out my old iPad from my nightstand, the last Apple device I own (other than the watch, but that doesn't do me any good here). My iPad is dead. Okay, so I plug it in. It takes forever to charge enough to a point where it can turn on. When I do get it powered on, I'm greeted with that "Hello" screen telling me to set up my iPad. Now what happened here!? Whatever, I go through setup. It hangs on the wifi setup step. I restart it and try again. I can connect to wifi. Great! The next screen tells me I need to sign in with my Apple ID before it will unlock. What the heck! I can't catch a break!

    My dad finds an old email with the serial number for the phone! We try calling Apple again. Maybe they can give us the IMEI number now that we have the serial number. Support directs us to appleid.apple.com. The guy says that will show us a list of every device ever associated with his account and will display the IMEI number there. I log into my dad's account and check the list of devices. It only shows devices currently linked with his account, not a history. The page is very limited and there are no options to view anything else.

    There was one other option I saw in that article for resetting my Apple ID password. It said you can reset your password using <i>any</i> Apple device, even if it's just one in the Apple store. I don't see why they even make an Apple device a requirement if there is no additional security there. It doesn't need to be a device I own, I could have just found a random phone on the streets. Anyway, I call my mom up and she opens Find My iPhone and goes through the reset password steps for my account. I try logging into appleid.apple.com. I need two-factor auth. My mom didn't get a code on her phone. I log into my Apple ID account on my iPad and unlock it, which I then use to receive the two-factor code and log in to the site. I see my old phone! Finally! After all this time, I get the IMEI number.

    I just sent the serial and IMEI numbers to the Google customer support rep and he said I will hear back in another 24 to 48 hours. All that hoop jumping better not be for naught.
