    Don came over yesterday for a bit of Netflixing, which was subsequently followed by some chilling. We ate some pizzas and watched a documentary he found called Expedition Happiness. Don and I often talk to each other about our pursuits of happiness, and how we want to give up the daily grind and dive into the van lifestyle and travel the world. So this movie definitely fit our interests. This German couple travels to America to buy and convert a school bus into what turns out to be a pretty fancy RV. They renovated pretty much the whole thing themselves, and it was amazingly well done. They are handy. Anyway, they take this RV bus they created and drive it all the way up to Alaska, then turn around and go back through Canada, America, and then finally Mexico. I guess they just wanted to travel and see the world, but by the end of it (<b>**SPOILARZ!**</b>), they were so tired of traveling that they just wanted to settle down in one place and not have to deal with all the headaches that come with traveling the world. I feel like not a whole lot happened throughout this documentary. I mean, <i>they</i> did a lot, but it felt like one long vlog. There wasn't much of a point or a story. We just got to follow two people on their journey. Though, I am impressed that they did the entire thing themselves. The girl even did all the music for the documentary herself. Pretty high production quality for two kids in their twenties.

    It wasn't too late by the time we finished the documentary, and I was still hungry, so I made some popcorn and we put on an episode of Black Mirror. I picked the Striking Vipers one because it was about VR and video games and it looked cool. I always thought the VR episodes were some of the more interesting ones &ndash; to me at least. It took a surprising turn, to say the least. And it got us talking about the possible implications of ultra-realistic VR that we may one day get to see in our lifetimes. I feel like there wouldn't be much of an incentive to keep your human body physically fit. At long as you are healthy enough to stay alive, you can just live your whole life (minus eating) in a simulation. Wild.

  <h2>Haircut #2</h2>

    Don has been asking for me to cut his hair for a while. Even before I cut David's hair. Finally, after that whole Netflix binge, I ushered him into my bathroom, made him take off his shirt (not pictured), and we got to work. This cut was a lot easier than David's hair because Don only wanted a trim with the clippers for the most part. It was fun cutting away at his long hair. He kept telling me to cut an inch or two off, but I'd just snip away a quarter inch. I've never had so much room to play around and see how different cutting techniques affect the look and feel of the hair. Even with the toying around, we were done in probably 30 minutes, cleanup included. Look at that grin after he got all his hairs cut.

  <b>Side note:</b> I definitely ate some 16-month-old ground turkey today that has been sitting in my freezer for, well, 16 months (older than a baby). Here's to hoping I don't die. And if I don't, then I have a <i>ton</i> of leftovers to pack for lunch tomorrow. <i>yisssss.</i>
