  <h1>
    New office!
  </h1>

  <p>
    We finally did the move. We did it. Apparently we had signed the lease for this place last year, and it took that long to get everything all settled and renovated and what have you.

    I arrived to find... well, nothing. I had no desk, no monitor, and no chair. I just had my box of knick knacks that I had on my desk at the last office (keyboard, mouse, tea, etc.). I started by stealing a desk from another team. It's only fair. Some people had already stolen mutltiple desks from our team before we even arrived. Then I found and plugged in a monitor, only to find the screen had gotten cracked during the move. On to the next monitor! The one I ended up with kind of sucks though. It's super pixelated and it continually loses connection with my laptop. I'll have to do a little swapperoo with another monitor at another point in time when we are not busy with getting everyone settled into the new office. Similar dealio with my chair. The first one was missing a wheel. Then the only free chair left was a leather one. While it is actually pretty comfortable, I learned last year that it gets pretty hot in the summer and a leather chair is just awful.

    But it's not all bad news! Someone brought in a ton of boxes of Krispy Kreme donuts and coffee for breakfast this morning. We have 3 big fridges (or maybe one is a freezer) for all the lunchbox space we will ever need. We actually have room to <i>walk around.</i> And we get free access to the gym in the building. Lunch was pretty cool too. We have a nice little patio outside with 4 tables and umbrellas. The weather was <i><b>beautiful!</b></i> Eating out there was a nice change from the overcrowded lunch table that I am used to. Plus Zappa, the office dog, was super excited to explore the new office. And that's all we need, really. I am still getting used to the layout. There are like 6 doors to get into the office once you get off the elevator. Plus there are so many nooks and crannies that I haven't even checked out yet. I want to do a bit more exploring tomorrow once our key fobs are working. I didn't want to keep asking the receptionist to swipe me up to our floor every time. Tomorrow is when the <i>real</i> fun begins.
