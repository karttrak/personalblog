  <h1>
    We lost power... again!
  </h1>

  <p>
    This is the second time the power has gone out in just a couple of days. However, this time I wasn't at my apartment. I went to my brother's house for a little family barbeque and fun. It was a good day. We hung out outside while my niece and nephew (6 and 4 years old, respectively) played in the sprinkler. Then some frisbee, some delicious barbeque chicken cooked over a fire pit, and then finished off the night with hide and seek with the whole family. Then we heard news of a tornado watch nearby. Thankfully for us, it was a couple towns over. But my nephew was so scared from the last tornado warning that he was freaking out the whole time. He wanted to go hide in the closet until it was all over, but his parents were able to calm him down enough to sit and watch the news with us. We only got hit with a short bout of hail, but some decent winds that blew all of nature around.

    On my way home, there were branches, twigs, and leaves blown all over the road. Some newly fallen trees adorned the sides of the roads. I even ran into a roadblock as some power company workers were trying to address a power line that had fallen across the street. The whole ordeal only added about 30 minutes to my already hour long commute, so it wasn't too bad, all things considered. But we've been having some hectic weather lately.
