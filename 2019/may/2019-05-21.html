<h1>I ran a mile time trial</h1>

<p>I wasn't even sure the track would be open at my local high school. I just went out for a normal run and decided to run by the track to check. I saw other people on there and got excited to do my first track workout in a few months.</p>

<p>I started with some stretches and a warmup lap to get used to the pace I needed to run to reach my goal time. After my warmup lap I had to catch my breath and rest a bit before starting my time trial. I stretched some more to stay loose and keep myself occupied.</p>

<p>The first lap felt good, though that is always the easiest one. Halfway through the second lap, my right shoe came untied. I had to decide whether or not I wanted to stop to tie my shoe and try again after a full rest or just push through it. The shoe felt snug even though it was completely untied. I kept running despite the distraction of the flopping laces.</p>

<p>Finishing up the second lap, I began to feel winded. However, the start of the third lap was not as exhausting as I've felt before. This was a good pace. I wasn't gassed, but I definitely wasn't comfortable. I rounded the curve at the start of my fourth and final lap, adrenaline starting to kick in to push me the rest of the way. I was ahead of my goal pace. I tried to keep good form despite my exhaustion, running relaxed but not easing up and slowing down. I reached the last 100 and just had to leave it all out on the track. I broke out into a sprint, or at least as much of a sprint I could manage at that point. My breathing was heavy, and I even let out an audible grunt as I pushed myself to my limit in the final 50 meters. I crossed the finish line and checked the time. 5:23. My second fastest mile since college. I still have a long way to go to approach my high school times again, but I can't complain.</p>

<p>My lungs hurt. I spent 15 minutes pacing back and forth and then slowly jogging a lap. Once I caught my breath and my heart rate lowered. I gradually picked it back up into some interval training.</p>
