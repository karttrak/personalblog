  Not a great day in the stock market today. However, I was actually able to use this opportunity to turn a profit! I didn’t do last well last year with my experiment with options. This year I am trying a new strategy. What I do is buy stocks in 100 share chunks and then sell a covered call that is out of the money. Translation: I sell a promise to sell 100 shares of a stock that I own to someone else at a future date and a specified price higher than it is currently trading.

  Why this works well for days like today: I sold these covered calls over the last few days, and now that the stock market has dipped, I can buy them back at a lower price and realize my gains. Specifically, I sold 10 covered (for a variety of stocks) calls for a total of $457 and bought them all back today for $302, netting me $155 of profit on a down day. I’m pretty excited about that!
