    Today was our last day in the office
  </h1>

  <p>
    My company is moving offices! It was long overdue. I remember people complaining about feeling cramped when I started, and that was a year and a half and 40 employees ago. We'll probably be cramped again in another year, but for now I will enjoy it. I've seen the new office once, but it was still being renovated so I'm not entirely sure what it's going to look like. I'll have to see on Monday. Movers are doing everything tomorrow, so the whole company is WFH tomorrow. I hear it has a pretty decent gym in the office, so that's nice. Plus now that there are showers we could use, I could run to work. This new office may be able to keep me in shape! Now back to the topic at hand...

    It's strange to think that now there will be an "old" office that I will have been a part of. It's probably not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. I moved offices at my last job and it was only big news for a brief period of time. But I feel like it's a much bigger part of the company culture here. Probably because there is always something to complain about in the office, so then someone inevitably responds with "Oh, dude, you should have seen how it was at the <i>old</i> office!" I've definitely seen this company grow a lot though. It has just about doubled in size since I started.

    Welp, this marks a new chapter for our company. Here's to hoping it's as good as the last.
