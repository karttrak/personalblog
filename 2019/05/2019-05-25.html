    I'm pretty much a professional barber now
  </h1>

  <p>
    I've been cutting my own hair for the last 12 or so years. While progress is slow (I only cut my hair once every 2-4 months), I've learned a decent amount over the years. Of course, the first couple years were simple hairstyles, just a buzz cut all the way around. Eventually I tried varying lengths with the clippers to taper at the edge and using scissors to style the top a bit. This allowed me to try longer hairstyles and experiment more. The most complex hairstyle I've tried is probably an undercut. It took a couple tries to learn how to blend sides and the back of my hair. But now I feel pretty comfortable in pretty much hairstyle I want to give myself, and I can knock out a haircut in about 20 minutes if I am rushing (minus cleanup).

    Last night I cut <span class="italic">someone else's</span> hair for the first time. It was a little scary at points, but I think it ended up alright. It was definitely a learning experience. I didn't realize how much it helps to <span class="italic">feel</span> the clippers against my head to know how much pressure I am applying and how close of a cut I am doing. Also, my friend, David, has a different hair texture than I do, so it didn't behave exactly how I am used to. There were a couple scares, but after David said he would give me a chance to fix it and didn't 100% want to throw in the towel and go to a real barber in the morning, I think I was able to fix most of it. You can see a before and after down below.

  <h2>Update:</h2>

  <p>David sent some new pictures now that he has applied some hair wax. I gotta say, he looks pretty good (and I love the goofy faces).</p>
