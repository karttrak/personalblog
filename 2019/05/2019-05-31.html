  <h1>
    My focus is terrible
  </h1>

  <p>
    Today is moving day, so I have been working from home all day. And when I say all day, I mean <i>all day.</i> I have been so distracted throughout the day with videos and music and food. I took multiple 2-hour breaks from working. But they weren't fully intentional. I would just get sidetracked. I did eventually get everything done though, around 1:30am. This is why working from home is a blessing and a curse. I love being able to stop whenever I want and go for a quick run or run to the bank or dentist without having to worry about anything. But when that freedom leads to distractions and I am "working" for 14 hours of the day, that's when it turns sour. On the whole, I enjoyed my day. There was plenty of entertainment in the form of Game of Thrones or random Youtube videos. But at the same time, there wasn't a lot of time that I felt I could sit and relax fully without thinking about work, aside from lunch and dinner. This brings me back to my Yext days &ndash; a <i>lot</i> of fun compared to a normal office environment, but very long hours. I don't hold this against Fundrise or anything. This was 100% my lack of focus that caused today to go the way it did. And I probably could have called it quits whenever I wanted to, but I really wanted to polish up the code I've been working on. And in the end, I am pretty happy with the result.
