  <h1>The power went out last night</h1>

  <p>
    I actually kind of enjoy when the power goes out in a city (for less than a day). If power outages didn't have detrimental consequences for other people, I would hope for them more often. Entire city blocks were pitch black on my way home. I walked into my apartment to find my roommate sitting in the living room with a couple of flashlights perched up like lanterns. It's like camping in a way, but with a permanent structure to sleep in. My time in the outage was short-lived, however. The power came back on only 10 minutes after I arrived home. Then I saw some glowing outside the window, and it was getting brighter and brighter. Suddenly, something on the power line exploded, plunging half of our apartment back into darkness. Curiously, only my roommates' bedrooms and the kitchen lost power again. The living room, my bedroom, and my bathroom survived. But worst of all... still no internet! I don't care how much electricity you have; if you don't have a fridge and don't have wifi, it's camping.

    The next morning and no change. Half of the apartment is still dead.
