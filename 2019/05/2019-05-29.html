    One week later &ndash; still getting used to Android
  </h1>

  <p>
    It's been a week and I'm still configuring my phone. I set the phone up pretty quickly, mind you. Most of everything transferred over pretty seamlessly. The time consuming part was transferring all the two-factor auth and logging into all my apps again. But this is a whole new world for me. I know next to nothing about the Android ecosystem, so I am discovering neat little tidbits every day. Like today, for instance, I just changed my default messaging app to Textra. I don't even need the old one anymore. All text messages just go through the new app. This probably sounds silly to an Android user, but as someone who has only ever used an iPhone (or a flip phone), it boggles my mind. This is more of a tiny computer than a completely enclosed mobile device, if that makes sense. The settings even refers to the home screen as the "desktop."

    The number of choices I have is pretty overwhelming though. There are dozens of apps for anything you are trying to replace. And I already mentioned how long it took me to decide on a new smartwatch to buy. It wasn't just a consideration of "Do I want to pay for the Apple Watch or not?" It's more like, "Do I want a smartwatch or a fitness tracker? Or both? But that costs more. How about the cheap knockoffs?" etc., etc. It seems similar with apps. Something I consider to be a "standard" app that I am used to being stuck with can now be replaced, but some of those replacement apps cost money. Paying money for a messaging app? Or a phone app? This <span class="italic">is</span> a phone! Why should I pay for that!? Maybe it is better and actually worth it? I don't know. But I noticed payouts in Google Opinion Rewards are higher. Probably because it is just Google Play credit and not cash. But I've already made $1.06 in a week. That's enough for a free app. Hey! Maybe I can buy a new phone app!
