    Car charging debacle
  </h1>

  <p>
    A little bit of backstory:
    <br />
    On the way back home from my brother’s house I passed up 2 superchargers in favor of the new supercharger that recently got installed in Arlington. I had never used it before and I wanted to check it out. It is the closest one to my apartment, so I wanted to get familiar with it. I knew this supercharger was getting added at some point in the Spring according to the Tesla website, so I assumed it’d be part of the new mall that just got built. Superchargers are often placed at large malls. However, when I started navigating to it, I noticed on the map that it is <span class="italic">not</span> the new mall. I decided to go check it out nonetheless. I arrived to find it at a small shopping center that has been around for as long as I’ve known, located on the 5th floor of a parking garage that charges $6 for the first hour. I was only intending on getting 50 miles or so to allow me to get to my parents’ house the next day, which is where I usually do the bulk of my charging. I had enough to get to the charger I normally go to at a mall that has plenty of stores to explore, so I hold off. Plus that charger is free, though much slower. This Arlington supercharger is fine as a last resort, but I don’t need to frequent it.

    So that was how I got into this situation where I only have 20 miles, but I need to drive 26 to get to my parents’. I arrive at this charging station at the mall and all the charging spots are taken, so I hold up in a nearby parking spot and play games on my phone while I wait for someone to open a spot for me. 20 minutes pass and finally someone walks up and drives off. I quickly back into their old spot, leaving it open for only a handful of seconds. Success! I go shopping while it charges. However, when I check the app, I see it’s only charging at a rate of 11 mph. That’s terrible! A little better than being plugged into any old wall outlet, but I usually get 25 mph at this place. It’s the only spot I have available to me though, so I have to suck it up. I check back 20 minutes later and all the spots are still full. This mall is always too crowded. 15 <span class="italic">more</span> minutes and I return to find 2 spots open. I do a quick switcheroo and finally I am getting some faster charging. It’s fluctuating between 12 and 25 mph, but most often charging around 21 mph. Good enough. I hang out until I get up to 30 miles of range. It’s nice to have a little excess since the battery can drain pretty fast if you are driving faster, and I don’t want to drive on the highway at 40 mph. On my way over to my parents’, I still drive fairly conservatively at first and I actually end up only using 17 miles of range to traverse the 20 miles from the mall to their house, so that’s pretty cool.
