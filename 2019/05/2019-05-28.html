  <h1>
    Deciding on a new watch
  </h1>

  <p>
    I've been searching around for a new smartwatch after switching to Android. I was struggling to choose between a few of the more popular ones &ndash; the Fitbit Versa, Samsung Gear Sport, or Samsung Galaxy Watch Active. I even heard about the Amazfit Bip, but quickly dismissed that due to the UI. There was also even the option of holding out until Google eventually releases their watch in the indeterminite future. After a bunch of research and watching video reviews and comparisons, I finally decided the Fitbit Versa was my best option. But, since I wasn't in any big rush, and now Youtube will be recommending watch videos to me for weeks, I figured I could hold off and see if any watches would go on sale. Lo and behold, the very next day I see an article for some Memorial Day sales on 3 watches &ndash; the Samsung Gear S3, Garmin Vivoactive 3, and Amazfit Bip. Cue another round and comparison videos. Then all watches just seemed bulky. I reconsidered the waiting idea. So far I like Google's products. And it sounds like the watch rumors have been out for a while, so the watch must be near.

    I started looking into getting a cheap crappy watch that would receive notifications from my phone and work as a basic fitness tracker. Some cheap watches actually looked halfway decent. But then I thought... if this would just get me through until Fitbit has a sale, I'm completely negating any savings from the sale with the cost of this cheap watch. Plus who knows how long it could be until their next sale? Or until Google actually releases their watch? So I started looking into the Amazfit Bip again, and the reviews slowly started to convince me. I don't know if I just lowered my standards so much from seeing the horrible UI on the cheap watches or what, but all of a sudden I found myself pulling the trigger on the Amazfit Bip. I guess the host of other features finally outweighed the meh UI in my mind. Having onboard GPS will be nice. And the long battery life will be a welcome change from the crapshoot of a battery life my Apple Watch has, ranging from 5 hours to 1.5 days. I'll have to see how this Amazfit performs. I just hope the Google watch doesn't come out next month.
