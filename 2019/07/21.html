    <h1>Brotherly hike</h1>

    <p>
      My brother and I went on a hike through Billy Goat trail yesterday. It was hot as steak out there! It got over 100&deg;, with a "feels like" temperature of around 110&deg;. The terrain was treacherous in some places &mdash; It's a very rocky hike, and even includes a little bit of climbing. Including rests and wandering around for some good views, it took us 3 hours to go about 3.6 miles. Fortunately, we were able to take a gravel trail back to the car, so we were able to finish up the last 2 miles in ~40 minutes.

      The views were gorgeous. We both have been to Great Falls several times, which is just on the other side of the river, so we've seen pretty much the same views before. But this time everything was <i>reversed</i>, which made it <i>new</i>, and <i>exciting</i>!

      It had been a while since my brother and I had gone on a hike, so it was good to get back out there. I wish the weather had been a little nicer to us, but at least it gave us something to complain about. Though I was dog tired by the time I got back and had to take a nap for a couple hours to recover. The heat just drains the energy right outta ya!

      Let's be honest, there isn't much to talk about when it comes to a hike. It's more about the views. So I'll keep this post on the shorter side and just plop some photos here and call it a night.
