  <h1>
    I had a realization about this blog
  </h1>

  <p>
    I haven't been keeping up with my original plan for this blog. I originally wanted to post something every day, even if it was something as simple as "I don't feel like writing today." The idea was to get into the habit of posting regularly. Obviously, a new post every day is hard. I am not trying to make excuses, I am just stating a fact. I <i>knew</i> a new post every day would be hard. I didn't even expect to keep up with it entirely. I went on vacation shortly after starting the blog, and then I moved apartments immediately after getting back from vacation. But my biggest impediment is that I want everything to be perfect.

    Perfectionism is a problem for a lot of people. I see Youtube videos and blog posts about it all the time (and here is another one). "Perfect is the enemy of the good." I remember my dad telling me that quote a long time ago when I wouldn't get started on a school paper I had to write because I didn't have a good enough idea for a topic. <i>Just get writing.</i> That is the biggest hurdle. Just <i>start.</i> Everything else will fall in place later. It seems like a daunting task if you have a giant project you want to accomplish. But when you think about it broken up into its components, each piece doesn't seem as bad.

    I thought it'd be cool to show this blog growing with each month. That is why I take screenshots of the homepage at the end of every month, so you can watch the site develop over time. I also try to keep each post looking pretty much the same as the first day I post it. I think it's cool to watch something grow. The problem with this is that I need to duplicate a lot of code every time I want to publish a post.

    I have more to say on this topic, but I will get to that another time.
