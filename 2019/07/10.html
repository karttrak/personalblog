  <h1>
    I had a realization about this blog
  </h1>

  <p>
    I haven't been keeping up with my original plan for this blog. I initially wanted to post something every day, even if it was something as simple as "I don't feel like writing today." The idea was to get into the habit of posting regularly. Obviously, a new post every day is hard. I am not trying to make excuses, I am just stating a fact. I <i>knew</i> a new post every day would be hard. I didn't even expect to keep up with it entirely. I went on vacation shortly after starting the blog, and then I moved apartments immediately after getting back from vacation. But those weren't even the biggest obstacle that I have faced in posting regularly. My biggest impediment is that I want everything to be perfect.
  </p>

  <p>
    Perfectionism is a problem for a lot of people. I see Youtube videos and blog posts about it all the time (and here is another one). "Perfect is the enemy of the good." I remember my dad telling me that quote a long time ago when I wouldn't get started on a school paper I had to write because I didn't have a good enough idea for a topic. <i>Just get writing.</i> That is the biggest hurdle. Just <i>start.</i> Everything else will fall in place later. It's too easy to get frozen in place when you start to think about how much work it will take to accomplish a goal. It seems like a daunting task. But when you think about it broken up into its components, each piece doesn't seem as bad anymore. Look at how popular Duolingo is. You can't learn a language in a week. But they break it down into individual lessons that are easy to handle. Then they reward you for reaching certain checkpoints. A bunch of small, incremental improvements, over a long period of time, can lead to substantial progress.

    I thought it'd be cool to show this blog growing with each month. That is why I take screenshots of the homepage at the end of every month, so you can watch the site develop over time. I also try to keep each post looking pretty much the same as the first day I post it. I think it's cool to watch something grow over time. And it's like having my own Wayback Machine.

    My goal from here on out is to get in the habit of pushing updates to the site more frequently, even if posts and features are not 100% complete. If I have an incomplete post visible to the world, I will be much more motivated to finish it rather than sitting on it for weeks at a time. As for features of the site, they do not need to be rolled out in one large change. I've been planning on adding a header and footer to the site for a while now. Instead of worrying about how to style the header, what links to display, and creating pages to fill in the menu, why not just start with something simple that links back to the homepage? That's it. Nothing fancy. But it's something, and it can grow from there.
