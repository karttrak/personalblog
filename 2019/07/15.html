        Weekend dining
    </h1>

    <p>
      This weekend has brought a lot of delicious food to my face. I went to Bartaco with a couple friends on Saturday. During the 1-1.5 hour wait, we decided to go to Cheesetique for drinks an appetizers. I ordered some warms oviles with manchego cheese. I was skeptical of the "warm" part of the olives. Olives don't need to be warm. They are delicious cold! But once I had them, I understood. I think the heat was meant more to soften the cheese rather than for the olives, but it was a perfect pairing. And it actually wasn't a bad price. $6 for a pretty large bowl. The olives tub I get from the olive bar usually comes out to around $7-8, but it's bigger. $6 for olives <i>and</i> cheese? AND warm?? I'll order it every time. We also got recommended the fried cheese curds by a native Wisconsinite. That was a <i>very</i> worthwhile recommendation. However, 2 minutes after our food came, we got a text saying our table at Bartaco was ready, even though it had only been 20-30 minutes. I appreciate a speedy wait, but GIVE US MORE OF A HEADS UP! You <i>know</i> your restaurant is surrounded by a shopping center, and you give us an hour+ to wander off. <i>Of course</i> we are going to be in the middle of something. Saying "Be is in 5 minutes or you lose your table!" ain't cool. &lt;&sol;rant&gt; We had to pack up, pay, and run away from a relaxing, enjoyable experience.

      Anyway, <span class="popup-target">Bartaco really knows how to make tacos. They also have a good bar.<span class="popup">I don't know how they mustered up the creativity for their name.</span></span> I ventured out a bit and tried a seared swordfish taco, which was great. I still think my favorite was the pulled pork carnitas. There is a reason carnitas are a classic taco filling.
