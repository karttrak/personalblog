    How business owners get paid
  </h1>

  <p>
    Have you ever wondered how a business owner gets paid? It's clear that she can afford to pay herself more if the business is making more money. But does that have to be a set salary? There is a definite advantage to having a predictable line item on your expenses at the end of each month. Joel from accounting would hate to think the business is going to have a large cushion at the end of the month just to find the CEO paid herself a paycheck twice the size as last month and used up all the available funds. But, coming from an employee perspective, a salary doesn't change often. How do you respond to the quick growth a new business might see in the first year? Does the CEO get frequent raises? Do you set yourself up with a low salary but then pay yourself large bonuses every month? Or can you simply take whatever profit is left in the coffer at the end of each month? I'm looking to find that out today.

  <p>
    My parents are starting their own business right now, so there are a lot of questions we are going to have about the whole process. Since I like to read a lot about finance, they assigned me two tasks last night.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Find out how business owners get paid</li>
    <li>Look into how we can get a tax credit for offering health care to our employees</li>
  </ol>

  <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: gray;">
    Notice how I said "we"? Hey, if I am doing research for them, I am claiming part ownership of the business. ;)
  </p>

  <p>
    So let's start with the first one.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Paying yourself
  </h2>

  <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: gray;">
    Now, bear with me. I am still new to all of this, so some (or all) of this might be wildly incorrect.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are a couple different ways for business owners to pay themselves. You can go with a salary or an owner's draw. With a salary, even though you are an owner of the company, you are still being paid like a regular employee. That's pretty simple. The other option, the owner's draw, is basically the "take whatever profit is left" route (though, you probably shouldn't deplete all of your company's profits every month). However, when doing an owner's draw, taxes are not automatically deducted from your paycheck, so you are responsible for paying taxes on your earnings yourself.
  </p>

  <p>
    The type of business you have plays a role in how the owner gets paid, as the tax implications are different depending on the business structure. S-Corps and C-Corps would typically pay the owner a salary, while sole proprietorships and partnerships would generally go with the owner's draw. LLCs have a little bit more flexibility since they can be taxed as either a corporation or a pass-through entity. This means that the owners can basically choose either a salary or owner's draw depending on how they want to handle their taxes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course, these aren't the only two options. You can still give yourself bonuses if business is going well. You can also get fancy with it and pair your salary with dividend payments. However, I have a feeling the dividend approach might be more for corporations and not for your mom & pop shop.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Health care tax credit
  </h2>

  <p>
    The Affordable Care Act made it so that small business owners are incentivized to provide a health care benefit to their employees. This benefit comes in the form of a tax credit, up to 50% of the employer-paid insurance premiums. There are a few criteria that the business owner must satisfy:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The business must offer a qualified health plan through the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/Health-Insurance-Marketplaces/SHOP.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Small Business Health Options Program</a></li>
    <li>The company must have fewer than 25 full-time employees</li>
    <li>The average employee wage must be less than $51,600 a year</li>
    <li>At least half of the employee's health insurance premium must be paid by the employer</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    However, there are a couple caveats to this tax credit. The credit starts to phase out at an average employee wage of $25,800. It also decreases as the number of employees goes up. Smaller businesses that pay their employees less get the biggest tax benefit. I believe our employees will be earning around $32,000 a year. And while we are starting from the ground up, we plan to grow quickly. According to an <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/shop-calculators-taxcredit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online calculator</a>, even at 22 employees earning $32,000 per year, we would not be eligible to receive <i>any</i> tax credit whatsoever. It's possible to receive <i>some</i> credit while we have 21 or fewer employees though, so at least that will be good while it lasts. Oh, and the full-time employee count does <i>not</i> include the owners or any family members of the owners, which will allow us to qualify for the credit just a little while longer.
