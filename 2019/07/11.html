    How business owners get paid
  </h1>

  <p>
    Have you ever wondered how a business owner gets paid? It's clear that she can afford to pay herself more if the business is making more money. But does that have to be a set salary? There is a definite advantage to having a predictable line item on your expenses at the end of each month. Joel from accounting would hate to think the business is going to have a large cushion at the end of the month just to find the CEO paid herself a paycheck twice the size as last month and used up all the available funds. But, coming from an employee perspective, a salary doesn't change often. How do you respond to the quick growth a new business might see in the first year? Does the CEO get frequent raises? Do you set yourself up with a low salary but then pay yourself large bonuses every month? Or can you simply take whatever profit is left in the coffer at the end of each month? I'm looking to find that out today.

    My parents are starting their own business right now, so there are a lot of questions we are going to have about the whole process. Since I like to read a lot about finance, they assigned me two tasks last night.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Find out how business owners get paid</li>
    <li>Look into how we can get a tax credit for offering health care to our employees</li>
  </ol>

    Notice how I said "we"? Hey, if I am doing research for them, I am claiming part ownership of the business. ;)
  </p>

  <p>
    So those are my tasks for today. I'll do some reading and get back to you.
