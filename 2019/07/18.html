    <h1>Next goal on my list</h1>

    <p>
      There are several things I already have planned for this site. I have some R&D projects in mind.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Tag posts and allow filtering on the homepage</li>
      <li>Decouple my folder structure and my URL structure (without a backend server)</li>
      <li>(Alternatively) Research free alternatives to host websites</li>
      <li>Implement scheduled posts</li>
      <li>Experiment with SEO techniques</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      There are also some content and design changes that I want to work on.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add an About page</li>
      <li>Add a Development Goals page (this post is half the work!)</li>
      <li>Add a menu on mobile (when the amount of content justifies it)</li>
      <li>Create a logo</li>
      <li>Look into using new fonts</li>
      <li>Create a gallery component for posts with many images</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Google Analytics</h2>

    <p>
      Having analytics for a website is critical for helping creators figure out what is working and what isn't. You can try to repeat what people love, and you know to avoid what disinterests people. I don't really want analytics for this reason right now. I have so few readers &mdash; or, at least, I <i>assume</i> I have few readers; it's hard to tell without analytics &mdash; that there is not much information I can glean from tracking visits. But why I <i>do</i> want to add Google Analytics sooner rather than later is because I want to add analytics to all my pages. Going longer without analytics just means more and more posts that I have to circle back to and add the analytics tag.
    </p>

    <p>
      It will be nice to have a way to see how much traffic my posts are getting, even if it's just "Hey! Here's Don right after I told him to go check out my latest post!" It will also be good experience for future web development projects. So before I get too deep into any other R&D projects, I need to learn about Google Analytics.
