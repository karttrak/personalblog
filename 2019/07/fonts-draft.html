      The importance of fonts
    </h1>

    <p class="roboto">
      When you're reading a long post, a bad font can make your eyes bleed. The most important requirement for a good font is that is must be legible. Don't use those fancy script or display fonts if you want the majority of your readers to be able to read through your content with ease.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Poppins
    </h2>

    <p class="poppins">
      This is Poppins. I liked the look of it when I was browsing Google Fonts and saw just a little snippet of it, but when I went to use it on my page, I didn't like it as much as a big block of text. The letters are very "bubbly" and seem to get lost in one another when you're just skimming the page. Also, the letter sizing is larger than Roboto, and without changing the line height of the typography, the white space between each line shrinks. It starts to look a bit crowded for my taste. I do like the larger sizing of the letters.
    </p>

    <h2>Work Sans</h2>

    <p class="work-sans">
      You see me I be work, work, work, work, work, Work... Sans. This was another contender that I really liked while browsing the Google Fonts library. But, alas, they don't have the italic typeface available, and I <i>need</i> my italics. Whoa. Did italics <i>just</i> work? I haven't even imported the italic version of Work Sans! Now, I'm not exactly sure what is happening here, but it looks like the browser is just applying some skew to the original text. I tested on Roboto, a font I know has an italic version, and the italics definitely took on a different appearance
