        Family business progress

      I have been doing a decent amount of work for our family business lately. We are starting a venture as an Amazon DSP (Delivery Service Partner). We will be delivering packages solely for Amazon. It's an interesting way Amazon set this thing up. They only started doing this two years ago, so it's pretty new to everyone. But Amazon basically set up a franchise to help people get their delivery businesses running, starting from nothing. They provide the warehouse, routes, and even people to load the delivery vans. We just hire and manage drivers and set them out to deliver packages.

      On Saturday I drove out to meet my parents to conduct some driver interviews. It was pretty casual. We met with a few people at Panera and discussed our expectations and their experience. It was nothing like the interviews I am used to doing myself in the programming industry. There were no coding questions (obviously). It was pretty much just a behavioral interview. We can't really conduct a test of their physical fitness or driving expertise inside a Panera. We really just have to take their word for it until they come in for training.

      I emailed multiple rental truck companies on Sunday to get quotes for renting backup delivery vehicles. That was out of my comfort zone because I wasn't even sure exactly what to say to these people I was about to email, some of which have fancy titles like "Southeast Regional Manager" and have special rates for renting 150+ vehicles at a time. And here I am, just some 26-year-old kid asking for 5 vans as a contingency. I had to read and reread a long document providing background info and explaining reservation processes and ask many questions before I felt prepared to reach out to these points of contact. And now they will call to follow up with me and I have to feign confidence when they start asking me questions and say "I'll have to get back to you on that" if I don't already have the information requested. This is the adult world.

      Now my dad is in Seattle for DSP training. He conference called me and my mom last night and we spent an hour and a half going over everything he learned. We definitely got a much clearer view of all the financials, something I thought they'd have explained in more detail a lot earlier on in the process. And now tonight he is emailing us another batch of notes.

      We might have already passed the point at which we are always on the clock for this business and I never even noticed the switch.
