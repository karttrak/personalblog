      Managing my blogging time commitment
    </h1>

    <p>
      I am spending a lot more time on this blog than I initally expected. While some posts are long and actually do take a while just to write the content, most of my time-consuming posts are the ones for which I need to write new code. This is where the blogging platforms like Wordpress shine. The coding is done for you. You have all the basic functionality ready for you right out of the box. But since I am coding my blog from the ground up, even the "simple" stlyistic changes I want to make take a while.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's been a while since I have done a lot of web development so I am out of practice. Any changes I make take a few iterations to get working properly, and I also have to determine how I want it to look on mobile as well. That's also the fun part, however. I like knowing that I can make <i>any</i> changes I want. Every single post could look wildly different if I had the time and motivation. I am not locked into one theme across the board. I can lay out images however I like. I am so used to writing code that can handle all these edge cases and work for varying sizes of images and lengths of written content, but here I can just hardcode specific designs that work for one single post. It's kind of freeing in a way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anywho, I want to try to limit my coding commitment to weekends when I have more time to put into implementing new design changes. Once I have some reusable solution coded up, like an image gallary for posts with many images, then it will be much easier to add that in to future posts and it will be less time-consuming. But until then, I need to make these posts simple for the sake of time.
