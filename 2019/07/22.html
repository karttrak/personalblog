      <h1>Meh</h1>

      <p>
        I don't really have much in the way of interesting topics to talk about today. And I really don't want to stay up late working on a post. I'd rather catch up on sleep that I've been missing out on. I guess I'll just update you on my day, stream of consciousness style.

        Work was pretty normal. I did a little digging into some cache managers that we have while I was writing unit tests for my code, so I learned a little more about that area of the business. I can't even pinpoint an exact thing I learned about caching, per se &mdash; I just feel a little more comfortable with it due to muddling around with it a bit.

        I went to the gym after work. Did all upper body today because the leg machines were being used. I also knew I was going to run home, so I didn't really want to tire out my legs too much. The lifting portion of my workout was pretty quick since I didn't want to get caught in the storm we had coming our way. It was just 30 minutes of pullups, bis, tris, lats, and farmer's carries. The run was pretty good despite having a backpack and running uphill for a good portion of the way home. 6 miles in 50:35. I was a sweaty mess afterward. It was gross.

        Now I'm just sitting at home, catching up on my emails for the DSP thing (I guess I should start calling that "work" soon) and watching some Youtubes. I had a delicious smoothie to go with my eating-peanut-butter-out-of-the-jar post-run snack. And now I'm munching on some beef jerky while finishing today's post. Well, not anymore. I just finished the beef jerky. And the post.
