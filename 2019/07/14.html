      Okay the header I made was pretty pathetic. It isn't so much of a header as it's just a simple link back to the homepage. I started the post in the morning at home and then ended up going to my parents' house where I have no computer to do development work.

      There are a couple issues I want to fix in my header. First, it needs color. I don't necessarily care <i>what</i> color right now, but it can't just blend in with the rest of the page.
