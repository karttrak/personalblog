      <h1>I bought new glasses today</h1>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, I don't have any pictures with them yet because I only paid for them today. I won't get the glasses for another couple weeks. It was a pretty good experience at the eye place though. I mentioned wanting to try Zenni. Of course the optometrist tried to sway me away from using them and to buy glasses from them instead, but eventually he did give me the information I needed once he saw I was adamant about trying it. But then he said it was going to be $40 to get my pupillary distance measured for Zenni! That's the same price as the glasses themselves! I ended up actually buying glasses right then and there. Not because he convinced me, but because they were actually a <i>lot</i> cheaper than I thought they'd be. I guess I have pretty good insurance that allowed me to get free frames &mdash; but only for the cheaper, lesser-known brands. Like, Sketchers? They make frames??

        The ladies there ended up helping me pick out a frame. They were fun. It was like putting on a little fashion show for them. I'm glad they agreed on a frame at the end of it all, and that just so happened to be my favorite frames after trying them all on as well. I hate when I ask for someone's opinion and then finally make my own decision at the end and go with something completely different. Maybe that means I just shouldn't ask for someone's opinion if I am just going to reach my own conclusion, but sometimes things become a little clearer after just talking through it with someone.

        It only ended up being $90 for the glasses, which was really only the cost of the lenses after getting the frames for free. My last pair of glasses were $250, and I even thought <i>that</i> was a pretty decent deal. Also, I got a $600 debit card to use on medical expenses thanks to my insurance, so really I am just looking for excuses to spend it all before the credit expires. I will also check out Zenni, maybe even browse its more expensive, more hipster cousin, Warby Parker, and <i>maybe</i> even buy some prescription sunglasses through my optometrist as well. I already have an <i>extreme</i> amount of contacts left over from my $600 credit last year, so I can't do that again. And the only other things I think the debit card is good for is copayments, which are usually only $10 per visit. And I can't really reach my limit with that. So it looks like buying a dozen pairs of glasses is my only solution.
