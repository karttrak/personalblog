      <h1>&ldquo;This is getting real&rdquo;</h1>

      <p>
        This has been my family's slogan for the past couple of months as we creep closer to launching our Amazon <span class="popup-target">DSP<span class="popup">Delivery Service Partner</span></span> business. My dad first applied to be a DSP several months ago. Maybe in February or March &mdash; I don't quite remember. I was all excited about it because it'd be a new venture with my parents and we would <i>own a business</i>. Then... nothing. We didn't hear back from Amazon at all. I would call my dad and ask about it every couple weeks and he would tell me there was no update. I started to think it wasn't going to happen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally in late-May, Amazon reached out to my dad and scheduled a phone interview. It took a couple days for them to reach a decision, but ultimately they decided to move forward with him. A week later and he was meeting up with a current DSP business owner and going out for a ride-along with one of the delivery drivers. Things were moving along pretty steadily.

        We went on a family vacation in mid-June. We were all dreaming about running a successful business and working together &mdash; my parents running the whole thing and my sister, brother-in-law (<i>henceforth known as BIL</i>), and I would help with managing the day-to-day activities. There were a few hurdles with us "kids," however. My sister and BIL each own their own house. My BIL also runs his own business, and he has two more years on his lease for that property. They started making plans, <i>while on vacation</i>, to solve these issues because they were just that excited to help with the family business. I also have a good job to consider, but my plan is just to work at the warehouse on weekends and continue my desk job until some indeterminate date when I am needed at the warehouse full-time. Shortly after getting home from vacation, my dad received an order summary for five delivery vehicles that we are leasing from Amazon.

      <p>
        A couple weeks later, my sister and BIL decide it's too much of a change for them right now. <span class="popup-target">They have two kids who are already starting back up at school soon<span class="popup">Apparently the Tennessee school year starts <i>really</i> early</span></span>. It makes sense. They have children to take care of, and I am glad they are prioritizing their children over their own desires. I, however, am not responsible for another human life, so I have the flexibility to do as I please. As such, my timeline gets propelled forward and I start making plans to get more involved with the business. I got in contact with multiple rental companies to shop around for some back delivery vehicle rentals. My mom started focusing on hiring drivers while my dad was in Seattle for training. And my dad was placing orders for equipment &mdash; phones, uniforms, and the like &mdash; while he was learning more about what we'd need for day one. A couple days ago, my dad sent me a picture of all the uniforms he got delivered, scattered across the top of our dining room table. The first physical evidence of our new business venture.

        Today, I put in my two weeks notice at my current job. This is the most real &mdash; and most <i>sur</i>real &mdash; this whole thing has been for me so far. I am excited for a new venture, new challenges, and a new chapter of my life. But at the same time, I know I am going to miss the relationships I've built with my coworkers. I've seen the company double in size since I joined less than two years ago. In that same period, I've seen our userbase nearly <i>quadruple</i>. I know there are plenty of new products and features on the horizon, and they will continue breaking ground in their industry. I am excited to see what innovative things they do in the future. But as I walk the halls, I remind myself that my time left here is limited. Soon enough I will be trading in my desk job as a software engineer for, well, a role with many hats. I'll be managing drivers, placing orders for vehicles, handling <i>everything</i> IT-related, and doing anything else that is required to keep the business running smoothly. I'm sure some days I will even be hopping into a van and delivering packages myself. This... this is getting real.
